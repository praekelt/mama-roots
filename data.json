You may have to sit your baby on your lap at first.</p><p> - \tShe makes chewing motions.

It was uncomfortable, almost painful - but manageable. I felt the dull ache at the bottom of my abdomen, just like cramps. That lasted about 2-3 hours. </p><p>Then, as my labour progressed, the pain got more intense. It didn't feel like period pains anymore. It got sharper and stronger. Luckily, there were breaks in the pain to rest. The pain would hit for a few seconds and then go away completely. I could still function during the breaks. I was able to talk to my husband and midwife. I felt I could handle what was happening to my body.</p><p>Then the pain got stronger. This was the final phase I had learned about. Breaks between contractions were shorter. I won't lie; the pain was fierce. It was hard to find a comfortable position. I just had to get through each contraction. </p><p>There were some moments towards the end that were scary. I felt tired and I just wanted it to stop. But the nurses were there to talk me through it all. They told me to just handle one contraction at a time... Just one at a time. And when I started pushing the pain seemed to get less. I just knew I had to push that baby out! And I did. </p><p>I don’t want to scare anybody who is about to give birth. I just want to prepare you for the most amazing experience of your life.

Singemuacha pekee yake. Niliketi naye usiku kucha. Hii ilinifisha moyo sana. Nilifikiri ningepatwa na wazimu kwa kukosa kulala. </p><p>Kina mama wengine waliniambia ningefanya mambo tofauti. Ningehakikisha kuwa mtoto yuko macho wakati wa mchana ndiposa awe mchovu kufikia usiku. Au ningemuacha tu aendelee kulia.</p><p>Lakini nilikuwa na umri wa miaka 18 na nilifanya nililoweza kufanya tu.</p><p>Mtoto wangu alipofikisha miezi 6 aliwacha kulia. Huo ndio wakati wa kwanza ambao nilianza kufurahia kuwa mama!</p><p>Mtoto wangu anafikisha miaka 2 sasa na anaendelea vizuri! Pia mimi niko mzima. Siku za kwanza ndizo zilizokuwa ngumu lakini sote tulifanikiwa! </p><p>**MSAADA WA MAMA: Kila mtoto ni tofauti lakini watoto wote hulia. Kumsikiza mtoto wako akilia kwa muda mrefu kunaweza kukutia hofu na hata kukukasirisha. Huenda usiweze kumnyamazisha mtoto huyo. Hata hivyo unapaswa kutulia na ufanye lolote ili kumtuliza hadi atakaponyamaza. Ikiwa unajua hana njaa, uchovu, hajajikojolea wala hana maumivu, pata ushauri kutoka kwa mtu unayeamini. Kwa pamoja, mnaweza kuamua ikiwa mtoto anahitaji kuonwa na daktari.** \r</p><p></p>",

Tunahisi kama tayari tuko na mtoto hapa, hata ingawa hakuna mwingine anayeweza kuona hili chubuko dogo. </p><p>Hatujaambia watu wengi kwa sababu tungali waangalifu kuwa tunaweza kupoteza hili chubuko dogo. Tutakuwa tumetoka kwenye eneo la hatari baada ya miezi 3. Sasa niko mwangalifu sana kwa mke wangu, kwa kuwa amebeba kitu cha thamani. Anaonekana maridadi sana, kiasi mwenye umbo la mviringo na anayeonekana kuwa laini na kung’aa zaidi. Najaribu kutobishana naye au kujitetea kwa kuwa sitaki kumkasirisha yeye au mtoto.</p><p>Tayari nahisi utofauti kiasi katika maisha yetu. Hataki kwenda kuwatembelea marafiki sana. Anapendelea kukaa nyumbani au kwenda katika matembezi wakati wa jioni. Na baada ya matembezi kwa kawaida yeye huwa amechoka sana. Sijali na ni vizuri kuongea kuhusu maisha yetu ya usoni kama wazazi tukiwa tumelala kitandani tukiwa tumeshikana mikono. Nahisi kuwa nimekosa kuwatembelea marafiki lakini ninahisi mwenye hatia kumuacha pekee yake nyumbani.</p><p>Amekuwa akijihisi mgonjwa wakati wa asubuhi. Tuliambiwa kuwa anapaswa kumega biskuti kavu au chai ya tangawizi na ilionekana kusaidia. Vitu vingi vilimfanya kuhisi kichefuchefu kama vile moshi wa sigara au baadhi ya vyakula. </p><p>Sasa huwa tunakula chakula kilicho na afya zaidi. Nimeungana naye katika mabadiliko haya yote ya lishe kwa sababu pia nahisi ni bora zaidi kwa afya. Mimi si mjamzito lakini pia huhisi vyema zaidi baada ya mlo wenye afya!</p><p>Hata hivyo, wakati mwingine mimi hukasirika kiasi, kwa kuwa kila kitu huonekana kikizunguka mke wangu na maisha mapya yaliyo ndani yake. Haonekani kuyatambua mahitaji yangu, matakwa yangu au mambo ninayotaka kufanya. Mwanamume wakati mwingine huhitaji kujiondoa kidogo kutoka kwa mazungumzo yanayohusu mtoto!</p><p>**USAIDIZI WA MAMA: Ni vigumu kwa kina mama wengi kulenga mtu mwingine yeyote wakati wa ujauzito. Huwa wenye furaha sana na kushugulika na mtoto anayekua! Msaidie kufanya chaguo jema, kula vyema na kuzingatia safari zake za kliniki.** \r</p><p></p>",

Kisha chuchu ya titi langu la kushoto ikavimba sana. Mara baadaye nikahisi bonge gumu katika titi langu. Lilikuwa jekundu na lenye joto.

Matiti yangu yaligeuka na kuwa makubwa sana na kujaa maziwa. Yalikuwa yamegeuka na kuwa mipira migumu ya soka iliyo na chuchu ndogo zilizochomoka. Mtoto wangu alijaribu kukamata na kunyonya chuchu ili kupata maziwa. Lakini sikujua kuwa titi linapaswa kuingia zaidi ndani ya mdomo wa mtoto. Chuchu yangu ilifaa kuwa nyuma ya kinywa ikielekea kwenye koo wala si upande wa mbele ambapo midomo iko. Hivyo mtoto wangu hakuwa ananyonya vyema. </p><p>Lakini sasa titi langu lilikuwa gumu na lenye uchungu! Nilianza kukanda sehemu iliyokuwa ngumu nilipokuwa nikinyonyesha, nikijaribu kuondoa maziwa yote ili kuondoa uvimbe. </p><p>Kisha marafiki wakaniambia kuhusu majani ya kabichi! Uyaweke kwenye friji na uyafunge kwenye titi lako yakiwa baridi. Uyaweke pale kwa saa moja au mbili. Unaweza kuyabadilisha na kuweka mengine yanapokuwa na joto au kunyauka. </p><p>Hivyo nikajaribu! Huku nikiendelea na kujikanda ninaponyonyesha, pia nilijiwekelea kitambaa vuguvugu ili kufanya uvimbe kuwa laini. Baada ya siku tatu, uvimbe uliisha na titi langu likawa lororo tena na halikuwa gumu wala kuwa na joto kama ilivyokuwa hapo awali! Nashukuru! </p><p>**USAIDIZI WA MAMA: Mastitisi itapungua iwapo utaachilia maziwa kutiririka kupitia matiti yako. Usiache kunyonyesha kwa kuwa hii itafanya hali kuwa mbaya zaidi. Hakikisha kuwa mtoto wako anaingiza titi mdomoni mwake inavyofaa. Jaribu njia tofauti za kunyonyesha ili umsaidie mtoto kujishikiza.**</p><p>\r</p><p></p>",

Some of my friends say I must stick to certain times in the day to feed my baby like every 4 hours on the hour.</p><p>But I can't possibly let her cry when she seems to be hungry and I can't force her to drink when she is not. So I just pick her up when she is restless and starts to niggle and put her on my breast. Usually she latches on and starts drinking until she is full. Then my breast, which was quite hard and full before, becomes soft and feels empty. </p><p>I try to let her drink from both my breasts to relieve the discomfort I am feeling when they get too full. My baby usually becomes very sleepy after drinking, so I gently hold her upright and let her burp and then put her down to sleep. And judging from the size of her yellow and smelly poop, she must get enough food!</p><p>Then another mother told me that I must give her cooled, boiled water between feeds from when she is 6 months because babies can get dehydrated. It is quite hot in the day, so I thought I would give it a try. But my baby has not sucked on anything else than on my breasts. So when I tried to put a cup in her mouth, she pulled a face and didn't want it. </p><p>She makes 3 to 4 big wees in the day. The urine is pretty clear and not yellow or dark, so I think that she drinks enough liquid. Her skin is also rosy and her face gets rounder every day. I had her weighed at the clinic and she is putting on the right amount of weight, so I am starting to relax now.</p><p>I found my way. My nipples were quite sore in the beginning but then somebody told me that my baby has to take my breast further into her mouth. My nipple mustn’t get squeezed on her hard palate, but rather be further back in her mouth, where it is softer. Since I did that, it doesn’t hurt anymore when I feed her. </p><p>Sometimes she doesn’t latch on properly and then I let her open her mouth wider and latch on again. Sometimes it works right away but sometimes we both have to try a couple of times. It gets easier the more often we do it. </p><p>Now I find breastfeeding easy and natural, and so convenient that I can go anywhere and feed my baby wherever I want!</p><p>**MAMA HELP: Your baby is getting enough milk if she is having regular feeds, 6 to 8 wet nappies a day and gaining weight. She needs no other food or liquid other than breastmilk for the first 6 months.**\r</p><p></p>",

When I was pregnant with my first child, I remember being surprised at how angry I would get with my husband. We had terrible fights! But now I’m quite sure it was just the pregnancy hormones. Thankfully once my daughter was born things settled down. But it didn't do my marriage much good.</p><p>Now, ten years later, I’m pregnant with twins. And those crazy pregnancy hormones are playing with my moods again! There have been a few days when I really and truly just lost my temper. But this time it’s not just my husband who has had to deal with my moods.  </p><p>Recently, I stormed off down a dirt road crying my eyes out in anger at something so small I can’t even remember what it was. Last week, I sulked in a room on my own when we visited my husband’s family for dinner. When I came out, I found my husband had taken my advice and gone home without me! </p><p>I also shouted at friends who were staying in our home with us when I came home from my job to find the dishes unwashed! Then there was the day I slammed our front door in the face of somebody who was trying to sell me vegetables. </p><p>I even burst into tears when somebody said something kind to me and helped me into the train carriage! </p><p>Thank goodness the rollercoaster is almost over... I just hope that I will be forgiven for my mood swings by the time baby comes.</p><p>**MAMA HELP: It's common to have mood swings during pregnancy. This is partly because of the change you face in your life. It is also partly because of the rise in hormone levels in your body. This can affect your mood, making you feel tearful or easily irritated.**\r</p><p></p>",

Make sure there are no small objects which could choke him, such as coins, within his reach. Put away sharp objects, such as knives, scissors and pens, and anything that is not safe to eat or drink.</p><p> - \tCheck that nothing can fall on your baby. Make sure everything is secure. Any electrical wires or other rope or cords should be rolled up safely and out of his way!</p><p> - \tKeep your baby away from fire and water. Your baby wants to explore; he may touch flames and burn himself. Make sure he cannot touch anything hot when you are cooking. Try putting up a barrier. Keep him away from large containers of water. Keep them covered with tight-fitting lids on top, so he does not fall in.</p><p> - \tRemember, when your baby starts to walk and stand, he may want to climb! Take care that dangerous objects and wires are out of his reach, and watch him to make sure he cannot fall off chairs and tables.</p><p></p>",

As your baby feeds more, your body will learn to make just the right amount of milk. Then your breasts will soften and feel comfortable.</p><p>For now, you can relieve the pressure by squeezing out a little of your milk. If your breasts feel too tender to touch, rinse a cloth in hot water (but not so hot that it hurts) and hold it on your breast. The milk will dribble out. Support your heavy breasts with a good bra or cloth.</p><p>If your breasts stay full for several days, it could be because your baby has not learnt to open his mouth wide enough when he takes your breast, and is not taking enough milk. Make sure he has a big mouthful of breast when he feeds. If your breast is very full, it could be difficult for him to get a good hold. Squeeze out a little milk before the feed so your breasts are softer and it is easier for him to fix on well.</p><p>Look out for signs that show he is asking to be fed, such as sucking his fist or becoming restless. It is easier to feed a hungry, wakeful baby than a hungry, screaming baby! Do not try and set a routine for your baby, but feed him as often as he wants.</p><p>After the feed, it may help to cool your breasts with cold, wet cloths. </p><p></p>",

Mkojo huwa safi na si wa njano au mzito, kwa hivyo nadhani anakunywa viowevu vya kutosha. Ngozi yake ni waridi na uso wake huendelea kung’aa kila wakati. Alipimwa kwenye klinki na anaendelea kuongeza uzani vizuri, kwa hivyo sina wasiwasi.</p><p>Niligundua njia yangu mwenyewe. Chuchu zangu zilikuwa chungu mwanzoni lakini niliambiwa kuwa lazima titi langu lisonge zaidi kwenye kinywa cha mtoto wangu. Si lazima chuchu yangu ifinywe na kaakaa lake, lakini ikae kwa mdomo, mahali ambapo ni nyororo. Tangu nifanye hivyo, haliniumi tena ninaponyonyesha.</p><p>Wakati mwingine hajishikizi vizuri na kwa hivyo mimi humuacha afungue mdomo kabisa na kujishikiza tena. Wakati mwingine inafanyika vizuri lakini wakati mwingine tunajaribu mara kadhaa. Inakuwa rahisi tunavyojaribu mara kwa mara.</p><p>Sasa nimepata unyonyeshaji kuwa rahisi na kawaida, na usio na matatizo hivi kwamba naweza kuenda mahali popote na kumnyonyesha mtoto wangu ninapotaka!</p><p>**USAIDIZI WA MAMA: Mtoto wako anapata maziwa ya kutosha ikiwa ananyonya mara kwa mara, anakojoa mara 6 hadi 8 kwa siku na kuongeza uzani. Miezi 6 ya kwanza hahitaji chakula chochote au viowevu isipokuwa maziwa ya mama.**\r</p><p></p>",

The extra weight will give you a cushion for the months when you breastfeed your baby. You can work at losing the weight over time to get your shape back.**\r</p><p></p>",

Your baby needs to be at the same level as your breast.</p><p>Turn your baby to face you, so her belly is against your chest. She may turn her head from side to side, making small sucking noises. This means she is ready to feed and is looking for your breast.</p><p>Stroke her cheek with your nipple. She will turn towards it and open her mouth wide. As she opens her mouth, bring her straight towards your breast. She needs some of the brown area around the nipple in her mouth so she can get your milk. She will use her tongue under your breast to get the milk, so she needs a good mouthful of breast.</p><p>Here are 3 ways to know your baby is feeding well:</p><p>Look! Does she have plenty of the dark area around your nipple in her mouth? Can you see her jaw moving up and down as she squeezes milk from your breast?</p><p>Listen! Can you hear her gulping milk, with short rests between swallows?</p><p>Feel! Feeding should not hurt! If your nipples are sore, she is not on your breast properly. Break the suction by putting your little finger in her mouth. Wait until her mouth is wide open and then bring her to the breast again. Get your baby checked by the health worker if she is not feeding well.</p><p>Remember, girls need breastmilk the same as boys do. </p><p></p>",

Alilala karibu na kitanda chetu kwenye sanduku kubwa. </p><p>Hata hivyo, kutolala wakati wa usiku kuliniathiri. Nilikuwa mchovu na mwenye machozi wakati wote.

Kisha tunalala tena. </p><p>Wakati wa mchana, mtoto wangu alikuwa macho na hakulala. Nilikuwa na wakati mdogo zaidi wa kufanya kazi za nyumbani kwani alitaka nimmakinikie kila wakati. </p><p>Rafiki yangu mmoja alinipa ushauri mzuri. Aliniambia nichukue muda kumlisha mtoto wangu vyema wakati wa mchana ili asiwe na njaa wakati wa usiku. Kwa njia hiyo, mtoto hatakuwa akiniamsha kula wakati wote. Pia aliniambia kuwa kufikia miezi 6, watoto huwa tayari kulala hadi asubuhi.  </p><p>Nilifurahi sana kusikia hivyo.

If your baby is small and weak you may have to stay at the health facility until he gets stronger. </p><p>Giving your baby breastmilk is one of the best things you can do to build up his health. The first milk you make is very thick, creamy and full of goodness. Give your baby this precious gift.</p><p>A baby who is born early may not be strong enough to feed at your breast. Feed him by squeezing out your milk into a clean cup. Sterilise the cup, wash it well and rinse with boiling water to kill any germs before you start squeezing out your breastmilk. </p><p>Use a cup rather than a bottle, because a cup is easier to keep clean and the risk of infection will be less.</p><p>Hold your baby on your lap. Gently tilt the cup so it touches his lower lip and a little milk enters his mouth. He will soon learn to start lapping the milk. </p><p>Your baby will also need lots of warmth. Keep him firmly strapped between your bare breasts to give him warmth from your body. </p><p>Wearing a sling helps to make sure he is securely placed. This will comfort him, help you both bond, and will also help him to develop. It will also help you to produce breastmilk.</p><p></p>",

Mara nyingi, jibu nililopata ni kuwa mkazo huwa kama spazimu ya hedhi.</p><p>Wacha nikwambie ilivyohisi kwangu…</p><p>Mwanzoni mwa leba ilihisi kama spazimu kali ya hedhi. Nilikosa utulivu, nilihisi uchungu – lakini ya kudhibiti. Nilihisi maumivu kidogo chini ya fumbatio langu, kama tu spazimu. Hii ilidumu kwa saa 2-3.</p><p>Kisha maumivu yalizidi, leba yangu ilipoendelea kukua. Sikuhisi kama maumivu ya muda tena. Yaliendelea kuwa makali na yenye nguvu. Kwa bahati nzuri, kulikuwa na kuacha kwa uchungu kwa mapumziko. Maumivu yatadumu kwa sekunde chache na kupotea kabisa. Bado niliweza kufanya kazi wakati maumivu yametulia. Niliweza kuongea na mume na mkunga wangu. Nilihisi kuwa ningeweza kustahimili yaliyokuwa yanaendelea mwilini mwangu.</p><p>Kisha maumivu yakazidi. Hii ilikuwa awamu ya mwisho niliyokuwa nimejifunza. Mapumziko kati ya mikazo yalikuwa mafupi. Maumivu yalikuwa makali; siwezi kudanganya. Ilikuwa vigumu kupata hali tulivu. Ilinibidi nipitie kila mkazo tu.</p><p>Kulikuwa na nyakati kukaribia mwisho ambazo zilikuwa za kuogofya. Nilihisi nimechoka na nikataka kukomesha. Lakini wahudumu wa afya walinishauri hadi mwisho. Waliniambia nishughulikie kila mkazo kwa wakati mmoja... Mmoja baada ya mwingine. Na nilipoanza kusukuma uchungu ulipungua na kuwa kidogo. Nilijua kuwa ni lazima nisukume mtoto nje! Na nilifanya hivyo.</p><p>Sitaki kuogofya mtu yeyote ambaye yuko karibu kujifungua. Nataka kukutayarisha tu kwa tukio zuri la maisha yako. Leba inachangamoto. Lakini ikiwa unajua unachotarajia, si la kushtua sana.</p><p>**USAIDIZI WA MAMA: Hakikisha kuwa uko tayari kuzaa. Panga mipango ya kufikia kliniki kwa wakati ufaao. Uliza marafiki kuhusu leba na uwe na maswala yake. Unavyozidi kufahamu kuhusu leba ndivyo unavyokuwa na uwezo wa kuwa na leba na kuzaa kulikotulia na kuzuri.**</p><p>\r</p><p></p>",

This results in blood being trapped in your legs. The pressure from the trapped blood forces fluid into the skin of your feet and ankles. This fluid would normally be absorbed by your body.</p><p>You will probably find that the swelling is worse as the day goes on. It will be better in the morning after you've been lying in bed. Try to rest with your feet up for some time during the day. Standing still for long periods can make the swelling worse, so try to sit down to do some jobs.</p><p>At the end of pregnancy, your hands might start to swell. Your rings may feel tight on your fingers. Wear them on a chain around your neck instead.</p><p>**Danger signs?** If you have sudden swelling or blurred vision, you need to see a health worker fast.

Each tightening usually lasts for about 30 seconds.</p><p>If you feel a tightening, place your hands on your bare bump. You can feel how hard your womb becomes.

You may think you are in labour. So how can you tell? </p><p>**How long do they last?** Practice contractions usually only last for a short while. Then they stop completely. So wait for an hour or so and see if they go away. Practice contractions often stop if you get up and move around. So maybe do some housekeeping, or go for a walk and see if they stop.</p><p>**Are they getting stronger?** Real contractions get longer and stronger as they go on. If your contractions stay the same and do not get stronger, they are most likely to be practice contractions.</p><p>**Are they coming more frequently?** In labour, contractions gradually get closer together. So they may start every 20 minutes, then every 15, then every 10, then every 5 minutes. The gap between practice contractions usually stays the same. </p><p></p>",

Hold him firmly so he does not slip and fall.</p><p>Lay a clean, warm blanket over both of you. This will keep the heat in. You can make a sling to keep him safe. Also put a small hat or a cloth wrapper over his head.

It was as if it knew I was not meant to be a father!</p><p>Before mine came, I wondered: what if my baby does the same thing? </p><p>I decided I never wanted this to happen - so I made a point of finding out exactly why babies cry. I asked all my expert aunts! This is what they say: … there are four reasons for a crying baby: it’s hungry, it’s in pain, it’s got a wet nappy, or it’s tired.</p><p>But can’t babies also just cry because they are sad? </p><p>They can definitely be happy for no reason. The moment my daughter gave me a real smile for the first time she was around 6 weeks old. It was my best moment! It was as if she became a real human being. Babies smile at their mothers and fathers and other people they recognise. Then they grin and chuckle, gurgle and giggle. </p><p>Now I seem to spend a lot of time doing funny things just to make my girl laugh – I pull silly faces, make animal noises, jump around like a frog, pull her toes. </p><p>When she cries I do the 4-point check. I first make sure she’s well fed, has a dry nappy, had a good night’s sleep and doesn’t have a thorn down her pants. </p><p>When I’m sure she’s okay, then I work on cheering her up for real.... I know some great songs. I can dance for her. Read a story. Tickle her feet…</p><p>**MAMA HELP:  A crying baby can cause a parent a lot of stress. First run through NewDAD’s 4-point checklist to make sure your baby’s comfortable. Once you’re sure she is, it may be time to bring out the singing and the dancing!**</p><p></p>",

      "content": "<p>When I started breastfeeding my newborn baby, nobody really told me what to do. I wanted to do everything as naturally as I could. After all, nursing dogs or horses don’t get taught how to feed their newborns, do they? </p><p>Well, I managed quite well for a few days. Then the nipple of my left breast got really sore. Soon after that I felt a hard lump in my breast. It was red and hot. My friend told me this was a blocked milk duct or mastitis. She said I had to be careful it didn’t turn into an infection! </p><p>How had this happened? My breasts had become very large and really full with milk. They had turned into tight soccer balls, with a tiny nipple sticking out. My baby tried to grab and suck on my nipple to get milk out. But I didn’t know that the breast actually has to go further into the baby’s mouth. My nipple had to be at the back of the mouth towards the throat and not at the front where the lips are. So my baby was not sucking properly. </p><p>But now my breast was hard and painful! I started massaging the hard spot while I was breastfeeding, trying to get all the milk out of the breast to take the swelling down. </p><p>Then friends told me about cabbage leaves! You put them into the fridge and wrap them cold around your breast. You keep them there for an hour or two. You can change them for fresh ones when they become warm and wilted. </p><p>So I tried it! And along with the massaging while feeding, I also put a warm cloth on to soften the lump. After 3 days, the lump was gone and my breast was soft again not hard and hot like before! Thank goodness! </p><p>**MAMA HELP: Mastitis will improve if you can keep the milk flowing through your breasts. Don't stop feeding, as this will make it worse. See that your baby gets a good mouthful of breast. Try different breastfeeding positions to help her latch on.**</p><p></p>",

We cannot even pay for childcare for one child, and soon we will have two. My husband has been taking on extra shifts to help. It’s tough because now he is hardly ever at home and we don’t see much of each other. I feel bad for adding even more on to my husband’s plate.</p><p>For the past two months I’ve been waking up at 5am to do some housework before my little one wakes and I get her ready for school. After I have taken her to school, I walk around the neighbourhood looking for work. I ask if there are any cleaning jobs I could do. I pick my daughter from school at 2pm, and then I have to keep her entertained, start making supper and the cleaning routine starts again.</p><p>Because I am so far into my pregnancy, I am heavy and tired all the time. I want to sit down and put my feet up, but there is no time for that. I have to do odd jobs and try to make what money I can. Now, I am wondering what it's going to be like when I have two. A toddler and a newborn. \r</p><p> \r</p><p>I have no time for my husband. I’m pregnant and exhausted. So how will I find time for my new baby or myself? Somehow I know that I must cope. Many women have done it before me. But sometimes it feels impossible. </p><p>**MAMA HELP: Are you expecting your 2nd or 3rd child? You will need help. Reach out to trusted older family members and friends who have children. If you are tired and alone, you may not be able to give your best to your children.
